            <h2>MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR</h2>
            <aside>
                <p>
                    Vave Academy is one of the most famous coaching institutes in Jaunpur for IIT-JEE, JEE Advanced, NEET, Pre Foundation and Foundation. Vave Academy was founded in 2014. I believe that success is not a one day Endeavour, rather a result of persevering efforts. Success in competitive exams depends on your ability to compete with others. As Charles Darwin stated in the struggle of survival as “the fittest win out at the expense of their rivals because they succeed in adapting themselves best of their environment” the fittest in context of IIT/NEET exams, the most intelligent and hardworking may not be the winner, rather the one who adapts himself to the changing pattern of the exam.
                    My organization Vave Academy has been providing quality education to students from the past 6 years. Although this is a mission with unlimited goals but I feel that we have had significant success in his short period.
